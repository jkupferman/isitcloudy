  <p>Ever wonder if a website is running on the cloud? Is it cloudy was created to answer that exact question. You simply type in the url and we do the rest.</p><br />
  <p>How does the magic happen? Its simple. Each website has a <%= link_to "WHOIS", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whois" %> record. By looking up the whois for the website we can determine if a website runs on the cloud and which cloud it runs on. The clouds currently supported are: <%= Website::CLOUDS.map {|k,v| v.name }.sort.join(", ")%>.<br /><br />
    <%= link_to "Home", root_path %></p>
